## About

This is this project. very meta.
I invision this project as a published form of notes. Currently the backend is just mdx + your favorite editor,
but I'd like to add more features and data flexibility

## Some changes to make soon

- a unified design system + better type hiearchy
- make all of the text and components responsive (!!!)
- cover images, auto picked from Unsplash
- styled components (pun not intended) for the basic information types (headings, lists, images)
- a more contentful and styled favorites page

## Future features to add.

- a custom video component
- bookmarks with link previews
- a desktop backend for editing (likely going to be a separate project)
- more data organization types?
  - tables
  - kanban boards
- templates
- more icon choices for articles
