### Websockets
[MDN Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)

### Webclient

The plan is to create a very simple web client to test Web Sockets and make the development of the web server easier.
This web client will then be later upgraded to a web version of the chat app

- write it in react from the get tbh. SPA time (CRA)
- an input for the websocket server address, requests
- display screen for returned messages
